'''
Variables are like container to hold or store your items.

Assigning variables in Python is slightly different from JavaScript. 

You have `const` and `let` in JavaScript which are immutable and mutable variable declaration respectively. 

But in python, it is simplier to declare variable and it is mutable.

# Assigning varible in python

animal = "Dog"

# you can reassign again as

animal = "cat"

# This is similar to `let` in JavaScript
